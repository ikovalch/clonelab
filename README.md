# Fast Formation

Analysis of the fast formation study

Dataset consists of 40 pouch cells built, formed, and cycled at UM Battery Lab.

Data exported from [Voltaiq](umichbatterylab.voltaiq.co).


### Folder Descriptions

- `code/`: source code written in both Python and MATLAB
- `data/...fifty-cells/`: from a previous set of cell builds, for reference only
- `data/...formation/`: data from formation cycles
- `data/...aging/`: data from aging tests
- `data/...diagnostic/`: data from diagnostic cycles during aging test
- `documents/`: reference documentsc
- `output/`: processed data output (e.g. eSOH fit results, features extracted)
- `paper.../`: drafts of the papers
- `presentations/`: PowerPoints and PDFs of content shared

### Notes

#### Questions to answer

- What are the basic SEI formation reactions involving the electrolyte salt and solvent?
- How does this SEI formation process change with anode overpotential?
- What is the role of VC in formation? How does VC modify the composition of the SEI?
