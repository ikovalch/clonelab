# Formation Data

Data from fast formation study.

Dataset consists of 40 pouch cells built, formed, and cycled at UM Battery Lab.

Data exported from [Voltaiq](umichbatterylab.voltaiq.co).

- `schedules`: schedule files for running on Maccor


### Battery Build Process Notes

#### Electrode slurry preparation

- For the positive electrode, NMC111, C65 and PVDF are mixed together in a 94 : 3 : 3 weight ratio using [ mixer equipment name ] with [ settings ]
- For the negative electrode, MAGE3, CMC, and SBR are mixed together in a 97 : 1.5 : 1.5 weight ratio using [ mixer equipment name ] with [ settings ] 

#### Electrode coating

- Positive electrode slurry was coated onto aluminum current collector using [ what kind of coater and with what settings? ]. The target a loading of 34.45 mg/cm2
- Negative electrode slurry was coated onto copper current collector using [ what kind of coater and with what settings? ]. The target loading is 15.7 mg/cm2.

#### Electrode pressing

- Positive electrodes were pressed using [ equipment name ] with [ settings ].
- Negative electrodes were pressed using [ equipment name ] with [ settings ].

#### Electrode calendaring

- Electrodes were baked in an oven at [x degC ] for [y days].

#### Electrode slitting

- Positive electrodes are slit to dimensions of 72 mm x 110 mm.
- Negative electrodes are slit to dimensions of 72 mm x 110 mm.

#### Cell assembly

- Electrode stacks are assembled in the following configuration:

CN|PAP|NCN|PAP|NCN|PAP|NCN|PAP|NCN|PAP|NCN|PAP|NCN|PAP|NC

NCN : Negative electrode - Copper collector - Negative electrode
PAP : Positive electrode - Aluminum collector - Positive electrode
|   : separator

#### Tab assembly

- Tabs are welded together using [ tab welding method / equipment ]  with [ settings ].

#### Electrolyte fill

- Electrolyte mixture consisted of 1.0M LiPF6, 3:7 volume ratio of EC : EMC, and 2 wt% VC (targeting 4 g/Ah)
- 10.55g of electrolyte was injected into the  pouch using [ equipment name ].

#### Sealing

- Pouches are sealed using a [ equipment name ].

#### Formation

- Pouch cells are charged and discharged according to the Formation Protocol at room temperature.

#### Degassing

- Pouch cells are degassed using [ method ].
- Following degassing, pouch cells are re-sealed using [ ].
