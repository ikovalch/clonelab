# Formation Optimization Project

Code used to extract features from formation tests run at the University of Michigan Battery Lab.

Sources data from [Voltaiq](https://umichbatterylab.voltaiq.co).

Requires presence of raw files in `data/`, which is not stored in the repo.

To view notebooks, enter the following command in your terminal:

```
ipython notebook process_formation_data.ipynb
ipython notebook process_cycling_data.ipynb
```

Use as read-only for now, since source data isn't available. Eventually I'd like to refactor this into .py files.
