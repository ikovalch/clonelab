# Fast Formation

Analysis of the fast formation study

Dataset consists of 40 pouch cells built, formed, and cycled at UM Battery Lab.

Data exported from [Voltaiq](umichbatterylab.voltaiq.co).


### Folder Descriptions

- `data/...fifty-cells`: from a previous set of cell builds, for reference only
- `data/...formation`: data from formation cycles
- `data/...aging`: data from aging tests
- `data/...diagnostic`: data from diagnostic cycles during aging test
- `figures`: figures generated for paper
- `presentations`: PowerPoints and PDFs of content shared
- `schedules`: schedule files for running on Maccor
- `src`: source code written in both Python and MATLAB

### Notes

#### Questions to answer

- What are the basic SEI formation reactions involving the electrolyte salt and solvent?
- How does this SEI formation process change with anode overpotential?
- What is the role of VC in formation? How does VC modify the composition of the SEI?
