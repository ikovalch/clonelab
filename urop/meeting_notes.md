# Meeting Notes

## 10/5/2021

### Notes

- We met up in GGB and got introduced to each other
- Reviewed the contents of the project homepage (GitHub repository)
- Discussed the list of TODO's for next week
  - Most important:
    - watch the YouTube lecture on batteries and attempt to answer the 'Battery Knowledge Check' questions
    - set up your GitHub account and try to get the code running locally on your machine

#### Milestones

- Get oriented
- Pick a project
- Make progress on project
- Present your work


### TODO's

#### Tools

- [ ] Get access to the Dropbox raw data path 
- [ ] Set up the source code 
- [ ] Set up your GitHub account 
- [ ] Clone this repository: https://github.com/wengandrew/fast-formation 
- [ ] Set up your paths and local environment and get the code running 
- [ ] Do all of the tests pass? (`python -m pytest`)


#### Social

- [ ] Join our Slack workspace and introduce yourself in #general 
- [ ] Get your profile picture added to our website


#### Research

- [ ] Set up a Mendeley account 
- [ ] Get access to the shared Mendeley Group (ask Andrew)


#### Battery Knowledge Check

- [ ] Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBLHaLhyo2w

- [ ] What is the chemistry of the pouch cells that we built at the University of
    Michigan? (Hint:
    https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2021-015271mtgabs)

- [ ] When a battery is charged, does lithium go from the cathode or the anode?

- [ ] What is the role of the separator in a battery? 
  - [ ] What is the separator typically made of?

- [ ] What is the role of the electrolyte in a battery?

- [ ] How is SOC defined for the full cell? 
  - [ ] What is the equivalent concept for "SOC" for a half cell?

- [ ] How is the cell capacity measured? What are some factors that determine this
value?

- [ ] When is battery voltage a reflection of the thermodynamics of a system
   versus the kinetics of the system? 
  - [ ] What are some factors that determine the kinetics of a battery system?

- [ ] What is the relationship between the measured full cell voltage and the
individual electrode-specific potentials?

- [ ] What are some of the basic performance metrics of batteries? How are these
properties measured? Which one of them are temperature-dependent? Which one of
them are SOC-dependent?


## Future Meetings
