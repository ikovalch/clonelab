# Meeting Notes

## 10/4/2021


### Discussion



#### Milestones

- Get oriented
- Pick a project
- Make progress on project
- Present your work


### TODO's

#### Tools

[ ] Get access to the Dropbox raw data path [ ] Set up the source code [ ] Set
up your GitHub account [ ] Clone this repository:
https://github.com/wengandrew/fast-formation [ ] Set up your paths and local
environment and get the code running [ ] Do all of the tests pass? (`python -m
pytest`)

#### Social

[ ] Join our Slack workspace and introduce yourself in #general [ ] Get your
profile added to our website

#### Research

[ ] Set up a Mendeley account [ ] Get access to the shared Mendeley Group (ask
Andrew)

#### Battery Knowledge Check

[ ] Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBLHaLhyo2w

[ ] What is the chemistry of the pouch cells that we built at the University of
    Michigan? (Hint:
    https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2021-015271mtgabs)

[ ] When a battery is charged, does lithium go from the cathode or the anode?

[ ] What is the role of the separator in a battery? [ ] What is the separator
   typically made of?

[ ] What is the role of the electrolyte in a battery?

[ ] How is SOC defined for the full cell? [ ] What is the equivalent concept for
   "SOC" for a half cell?

[ ] How is the cell capacity measured? What are some factors that determine this
value?

[ ] When is battery voltage a reflection of the thermodynamics of a system
   versus the kinetics of the system? [ ] What are some factors that determine
   the kinetics of a battery system?

[ ] What is the relationship between the measured full cell voltage and the
individual electrode-specific potentials?

[ ] What are some of the basic performance metrics of batteries? How are these
properties measured? Which one of them are temperature-dependent? Which one of
them are SOC-dependent?
