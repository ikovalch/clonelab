# Battery Data Analysis Project

Fall 2021

University of Michigan

Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) Project

Students
- Roger Ho
- Iaroslav Kovalchuk

## Goals

1. Contribute to the frontiers of battery research
2. Learn about how batteries work
3. Pick up practical data analysis and programming skills


### Battery Research

- Top-down approach: start from societal need and identify relevant problem statements
- You pick what specific project you want to work on
- Theme: methods for battery lifetime modeling, estimation, and prediction
- Theme: data-driven analysis and modeling of battery behavior
- End goal: technical reports and journal publications

### How Batteries Work

- Working principles of battery operation
- Basic materials science and electrochemistry of batteries
- How batteries are modeled from a systems perspective

### Data Analysis and Programming

- Version control and project management in GitHub
- Python for data analysis and batery modeling (PyBAMM)
- Developing sound programming best practices to produce high-quality code

## Format

- Weekly group check-ins
  - Report on work progress since last week
  - Discuss open questions and concerns
  - Assign next steps for next week

- Work product
  - Share your work by creating Pull Requests in the repository

- First few weeks: get oriented with tools and project scope

- Remaining time: commit to a specific project and finish it
